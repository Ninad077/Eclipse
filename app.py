st.markdown("""Hi, Ninad here. Eclipse is an open source web application designed by me to teach Machine Learning. It spans through core Python
                Preprocessing, Machine Learning & Deep Learning models step by step in a way that even a layman would understand. Rest assured, I have tried to 
                break down complex concepts with simple examples so that the user gets a clear picture of everything. I would recommend the user 
                to start following the course from the first session and follow it religiously till the last one. To make things easy for the user, 
                I have divided the lecture series into multiple sections namely Python Preprocessing, Supervised ML, Unsupervised ML, Reinforcement
                ML & Deep Learning.
                I have enclosed the essential datasets and Jupyter notebooks in every session so that people can refer and practice at their own comfort 
                at home. We would be using Jupyter notebooks to code and the language used is Python. I would give you a brief introduction to Jupyter notebbok 
                and get you familiar with Jupyter notebook environment on Anaconda navigator. For the entire lecture series, I would recommend you to download 
                Anaconda environment & Jupyter notebook on your local PC first. I have enclosed some installation blogs in the links down below, please go through
                them and install the setup first. Other non-technical prerequisites you need are: **Passion & curiosity**. Be passionate & be curious about the
                things to learn & don't be intimidated if you don't understand something. Machine learning requires practice and with time you would be proficient. 
                My only advice to you is that, make your foundations about the core concepts very clear which would prepare you to learn more advanced concepts in 
                future with ease. The entire Machine Learning is taught using several libraries most important being scikit learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib & seaborn. 
                On the other hand, the most important Library used in Deep Learning is tensorflow. So once you learn the basics well, try implementing projects using these 
                libraries so that you get well versed in them with time. Also, I am of the opinion that learning something is no less than implementing a Machine 
                Learning algorithm, the more you train, the better would be results. So keep practicing every day.
                I have kept this application open source because in the era of MOOCs which do charge subscription, I  don't want to make money an impediment for someone
                who has the zeal within him or her to learn something new. 
                For any query related to Machine Learning feel free to text me in the Query box below. To get started, select a Section from the navigation bar above and 
                follow the lecture series listed in the sidebar (extreme left of your screen).
                Hope you will have fun!
                Happy Learning :)""")
