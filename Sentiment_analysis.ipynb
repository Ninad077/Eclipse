    "As seen above, the sentiment 'The hotel was very good' was categorized as 'happy' indicating the model is working fine. This is how one can go ahead and predict the sentiment of a sentence. One thing to understand here is that the prediction here is a classification based which means we are categorizing the sentiments into different classes at the end of the model. The output 'happy' is a class."
